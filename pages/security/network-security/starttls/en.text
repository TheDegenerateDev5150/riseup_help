h2. About StartTLS

StartTLS is used to encrypt the network connection between mail providers when they relay email.

Things that are great about StartTLS:

* It is *easy to use*, you don't have to think about it.
* It allows protection of meta-data from dragnet surveillance.

Disadvantages:

* The user has no way to prove that a particular message was transmitted securely.

Riseup practices StartTLS verification with some of the other activist email providers.

h2. A horrible email journey

* Red: Insecure, email can be read by a listener (or email headers if the body is encrypted with OpenPGP)
* Green: Secure, the transport is encrypted.
