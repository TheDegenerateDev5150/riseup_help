Want to make some Riseup t-shirts, buttons, patches, or stickers? Cool. Here are some graphics files to help. We only ask that you [give us](https://riseup.net/donate) a chunk of whatever you make. To get the source SVG file, click on the preview.

## apt-get install anarchism

This one is really geeky. Either you get the joke and think it is the coolest thing ever, or it is really confusing (the image is a modification of the logo for the [Debian GNU/Linux operating system](https://debian.org), the ethical OS preferred by nine out of ten anarcho-geeks worldwide).
