%h2 What is a VPN?

Riseup offers Personal VPN service for censorship circumvention, location anonymization and traffic encryption. To make this possible, it [[sends all your internet traffic through an encrypted connection => how-vpn-works]] to riseup.net, where it then goes out onto the public internet.
  
%p
  Unlike most other VPN providers, Riseup does not log your IP address.

%p
  Riseup has a VPN client called <b>RiseupVPN</b>. This VPN client is super easy to use! You just install it and run it&mdash;no configuration, no account registration.

%p
  This is an experiment to see if we can create a VPN service that is easy enough for everyone to use and that people will donate enough to sustain.

%h2 Why would you want to use the Riseup VPN?

At Riseup, we believe it is important for everyone to use some technology like VPN or [[security/tor]] to encrypt their internet traffic. Why? Because the internet is being broken by governments, internet service providers (ISPs), and corporations. [[RiseupVPN will fight that => why-is-needed]]

%h2 Limitations to using a VPN

All VPNs share [[some limitations => limitations]], please familiarize yourself with these so you understand what the VPN does and does not provide.

%h2 Using RiseupVPN

%p
  On Mac, Windows and Linux RiseupVPN will create a system tray menu with an icon that indicates if the VPN is connected or not:

%p
  %img(src="/vpn/vpn_off.png") &mdash; VPN is off.

%p
  %img(src="/vpn/vpn_on.png") &mdash; VPN is on, and all traffic is securely routed through the VPN.

%p
  %img(src="/vpn/vpn_blocked.png") &mdash; VPN is off, and all traffic is blocked.

%p
  %img(src="/vpn/vpn_wait_0.png") &mdash; VPN is connecting, and all traffic is blocked.

%p
  To turn on or off, just click on the system tray icon and select the appropriate menu item.

%h2 What about Bitmask/Riseup Black?

The Bitmask-based VPN (which we were calling "Riseup Black") is no longer supported and has been replaced by RiseupVPN. RiseupVPN has all the features that made Bitmask special, in fact under the hood RiseupVPN is using the Bitmask code, but it has better multiplatform support, no more users and passwords to increase your anonymity and an even simplier user experience.

%p
If you still have Bitmask installed, please remove it before installing RiseupVPN.

%p
Accounts that were registered through this system will be eventually removed, and the logins made available to users to register.
